path: "inclusion"
pageTitle: "Inclusion"
purpose: "Change the face of tech to reflect the diversity in our region by creating an environment where underrepresented groups feel safe, supported and encouraged to pursue tech careers. What talent and what innovation is being missed because someone isn’t saying, “You should come join us.”"

challenge: "We will create awareness around action on three levels: find and leverage data to strengthen the inclusion narrative, highlight events targeting underrepresented groups in tech and bring underrepresented groups to mainstream tech events where their participation is typically lacking."

goalsDescription: "<ul><li>Identify major efforts supporting women, minorities and LGBTQ communities in tech </li><li>Provide support to one STEM event at different school levels to increase exposure &amp; participation by underrepresented groups</li><li>Start a SDTH Conference and invite women and members of other underrepresented groups to speak</li></ul>"

      bioDescription: "<p>Christie Marcella is the Economic Development Director for the City of Carlsbad and has been a Carlsbad resident since 2012. Originally from New York State, she has been living in California since 2009 thanks to the military service of her husband. Inclusion is important not just from a social justice and moral standpoint, but as a business imperative. Businesses she meets with are increasingly citing the cost of living as a hindrance to their growth and talent acquisition efforts. Making sure the people who are in our communities have access to opportunities that will meet the needs of our innovation economy is a must if our region is going to continue to see growth.</p>",
