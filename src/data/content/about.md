  Is San Diego a tech hub?  That was the question I asked on Thursday, December 6th, 2018 to a small group of passionate professionals looking to make a difference in the San Diego tech community.  As the discussion concluded, we realized we were missing a unified tech front.  We agreed San Diego had some “tech hubbing” going on across Downtown, Sorrento Valley, and North County, however, these tech communities were operating in a silo.  This begged the question, “what could be accomplished if we **ALL** worked together?”.


  That thought sparked a movement towards change -- Was it possible to bring the San Diego tech community together for the betterment of businesses, organizations, and individuals with the common goal of changing the perception of what it means to be a tech hub for San Diego?


  We had our mission -- Be conduits for change, by helping to build a stronger San Diego tech community through collaboration.  Our goal is not to duplicate efforts, but rather bridge gaps and encourage connections to drive transformative change across the tech community within San Diego.


  **We are Conduits.  We are Change.  We are San Diego.**
